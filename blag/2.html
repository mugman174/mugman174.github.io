			<p>Since I'm bored, I'm making a blag post.</p>
			<p>I don't know what to write, so I will post random stuff I use and reviews and whatnot.</p>
			<br/>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://fosscord.com">Fosscord</a>: Definitely not production ready, its Discord but open-source, and all the other benefits of being open source. You can run your own server, like how Matrix lets you run homeservers. It uses node.js and typescript‚Ä¶</li>
			<br/>
			<li><a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a>: Nice messaging protocol that's better than many of the more popular message apps, however, I still don't know where my encryption keys are...</li>
			<br/>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord">Pycord - a Discord.PY replacement</a>: Since <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1">discord.py was discontinued</a>, Pycord is taking on the challenge of continuing it. So far, support for slash commands has been added. Its a nice lib, but the release/latest branch has no changes from discordpy, so hopefully they'll push updates to it soon.</li>
			<br/>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a>: A very nice tiling manager with gaps and stuff. I might move to dwm at some point if I feel like it, but for now, I'm sticking with this.</li>
			<br/>
			<li><a href="https://ish.app">iSH</a>: Nice linux emulator I use on an old iPhone I have. Runs Alpine Linux by default, you can run any i386 rootfs on it. It has the <code>apk</code> package manager which can install many packages, and you can compile anything not in the repos for yourself.</li>
